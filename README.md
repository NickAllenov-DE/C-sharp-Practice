# C# Practice Repository

## Overview

This repository contains a series of C# exercises focused on fundamental programming concepts, including working with arrays, matrices, recursion, and basic algorithms. Each exercise is implemented as a separate C# file, allowing you to focus on specific programming skills.

## Repository Structure

The repository includes the following types of exercises:

- **Array Operations**: Sorting, searching, and manipulation of arrays.
- **Matrix Operations**: Filling, rotating, and performing calculations on matrices.
- **Basic Algorithms**: Fibonacci sequence, factorial calculation, and other algorithmic problems.
- **Recursion**: Implementing recursive methods for mathematical and algorithmic problems.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/NickAllenov-DE/C-sharp-Practice.git

```
Open any of the .cs files in your preferred C# development environment (such as Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code) and run the program.

## Examples  
Here are a few examples of the exercises available:

Factorial Calculation: Calculates the factorial of a given number using both iterative and recursive methods.  
Array Sorting: Sorts an array using different sorting algorithms.  
Matrix Manipulation: Various exercises for creating, filling, and modifying matrices.
